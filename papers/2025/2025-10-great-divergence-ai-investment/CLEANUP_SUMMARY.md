## 💡 Recommendations for Future Papers

### Best Practices:
1. **Verify before citing**: Check all URLs and arXiv IDs before including
2. **Use DOIs when available**: They're permanent and verifiable
3. **Avoid future dates**: Don't cite papers that don't exist yet
4. **Check arXiv format**: YYMM.NNNNN format (2502 = February 2025)
5. **Keep institutional reports general**: Cite organization's research page, not specific URLs
6. **Separate claims from citations**: Industry knowledge doesn't always need formal citation

### For Institutional Reports:
- ✅ DO: Cite major firms' general research
- ✅ DO: Use company websites/research sections
- ❌ DON'T: Construct URLs for reports you haven't verified
- ❌ DON'T: Cite internal/proprietary documents

### For arXiv Papers:
- ✅ DO: Verify the paper exists before citing
- ✅ DO: Check the date makes sense (not future)
- ❌ DON'T: Cite papers from future months
- ❌ DON'T: Guess at arXiv IDs

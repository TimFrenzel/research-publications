**Action**: Visit https://arxiv.org/abs/[ID] for each to verify

### ‚ùå LIKELY NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

These may be internal/proprietary documents:
- `point72_2025` - Turion AI Fund report (likely internal)
- `wellsfargo2025` - SR11-7 document (likely internal)
- `vanguard2024` - Internal research
- `northern2024` - Internal research
- `validmind2025` - Vendor research

**Options**:
1. Remove these and cite only publicly available information
2. Change citation to "Personal communication" or "Proprietary research"
3. Replace with press releases or public announcements about these topics

### üîç VERIFY SSRN/OTHER

- `joshi2025` - SSRN:5246289 - Check https://papers.ssrn.com/
- `kim2024` - SSRN:4835311 - Check https://papers.ssrn.com/
- `aqr2024trading` - Journal of Portfolio Management citation needs verification
- `microsoft2025` - ICML 2025 (future conference)

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Conservative Approach (Recommended for Academic Publication)
Remove all unverifiable sources and keep only:
- Peer-reviewed journal articles with DOIs
- Verified arXiv papers
- Major institutional reports you can confirm exist
- SSRN papers you can access

### Option 2: Industry White Paper Approach (Current)
Keep all sources but:
- Add notes indicating which are based on company announcements/press releases
- Remove specific URLs that don't work
- Cite as "Institutional research" without URLs where appropriate

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Keep academic sources with DOIs
- Keep major consulting firms (BCG, McKinsey, CFA) with generic URLs to their research sections
- Convert internal reports to "Cited in [press release]" format
- Remove arXiv papers that can't be verified

## Quick Fix Commands

To remove potentially problematic sources:

```bash
# Remove entries with "URL needs verification" or "Likely internal" notes
# Manually edit references.bib and remove those entries
```

## Citations in Paper That May Break

If you remove references, you'll need to remove or update citations in `paper.qmd` for:
- Wells Fargo SR11-7 framework
- Point72 Turion fund performance
- Various internal research citations

## Suggested Alternative Sources

Instead of proprietary reports, consider citing:
- **Press releases** from these firms announcing AI initiatives
- **SEC filings** for publicly traded firms
- **Conference presentations** (if publicly available)
- **News articles** in Bloomberg, Financial Times, WSJ covering these developments

## Next Steps

1. Decide which approach (1, 2, or 3) fits your needs
2. Verify critical sources you want to keep
3. Update `references.bib` accordingly
4. Check `paper.qmd` for any broken citations
5. Re-render and test
